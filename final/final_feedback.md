# Feedback on Final

Really nicely done final project.  Your clearly explained not only what you were doing, but the context of why it needed to be done and the conclusions you could draw from the work.  Your introduction and conclusion were solid.

One of the requirements of the final project was to use functions to organize your code and make it more managable and testable.  You created a single function that really didn't serve to help your code. It didn't encapsulate the logic of your in any way, but your code was well organized in general.  (-5 Modularity and Style)
